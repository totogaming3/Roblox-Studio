# Roblox Studio

**Welcome to my Roblox Studio repository!**

Here, I will post every single models and scripts that I allow to be used all over the games.
There will not be a lot of scripts, because I am not a big scripter.

## How to insert the items in Roblox Studio

This is very simple: 
- 1. Open your File Explorer.
- 2. Navigate in the directory the models are located into.
- 3. Open Roblox Studio.
- 4. Open your game.
- 5. Go back to your file explorer.
- 6. Drag the file(s) onto the Roblox Studio window.
