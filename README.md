# Roblox Studio

**Welcome to my Roblox Studio repository!**

Here, I will post every single models and scripts that I allow to be used all over the games.
There will not be a lot of scripts, because I am not a big scripter.

## How to insert the items in Roblox Studio

This is very simple:
Models and UIs:
- 1. Open your File Explorer.
- 2. Navigate in the directory the models are located into.
- 3. Open Roblox Studio.
- 4. Open your game.
- 5. Go back to your file explorer.
- 6. Drag the file(s) onto the Roblox Studio window.

If, for some reason, it doesn't work, follow these steps:
- 1. Open your game in Roblox Studio.
- 2. At the top of your screen, go to Model -> Advanced -> Model, now navigate to the models' directory and Open it.

Scripts:
- 1. Open the script with Notepad or any other text app.
- 2. Press ctrl+A and then ctrl+c.
- 3. Go back to the top of the script and, if it says in the Script type section "Script", create a Script and in it's data click ctrl+v, for LocalScript, do the same but create a LocalScript.
